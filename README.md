CSCI 325 Mobile Application Development: Project 2

In this project, you and your teammates will work to develop the app. called “Health Profiler”.  The app. will record and keep track of his/her health information.  This term project is not individual efforts; both you and your teammates must work together on this project

# Health Profiler:

This app. requires that a user input his/her age, height (in inches), and weight (in pounds).  The app. also calculates maximum heart rate and target heart rate, and body mass index (BMI). 

Use the following formula to calculate BMI, maximum heart rate and target heart rate range:

The program should notify to the user what the BMI value means.

- If BMI value is in 19 to 24, he/she is "Normal".
- If BMI value is in 25 to 29, he/she is "Overweight".
- If BMI value is in 30 to 39, he/she is "Obese".
- If BMI value is bigger than 40, he/she is "Extreme Obesity".

The app. requires saving these information into database.  The app. notifies a user his/her current status of BMI, and target heart rate for his/her exercise intensity.  The app. should have capability to update BMI so that he/she knows how much his/her diet is successful.  In addition, the app. has capability to show daily meal plan for his/her diet.  The total Kcal in a day and each meal (quantity of meal must be notified. For example, 200grams of pasta with tomato sauce) should be displayed for a user.  This daily meal plan should be sent to his/her email so that he/she can keep this information for future analysis.  The app. also should have capability to show line graph that display his/her BMI alteration.
